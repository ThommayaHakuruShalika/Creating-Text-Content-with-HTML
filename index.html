        Changes that begin in the ice at the tops of high mountain ranges are
        cascading down to lower altitudes. As the world warms, they are changing
        borders, livelihoods and the shapes of mountains along the way.

        It is a sunny day in autumn, and I am walking up a rocky slope next to a
        glacier at around 3,000m (9,800ft) above sea level, on the border
        between Austria and Italy. Next to me is Paul Grüner, the owner of a
        mountain refuge on the Italian side, which overlooks the glacier. Two
        brown ibexes – a type of wild mountain goat – graze peacefully by a
        turquoise glacial lake, their long, curved horns peeking out between the
        rocks. At our feet, a southern slope leads down into Italy, and on the
        other side, a northern slope faces Austria. Nearby, a weather-beaten
        wooden signpost with an arrow reads "Grenze / Confine" – meaning
        "border", in German and Italian, both of which are spoken in this
        multilingual area.

        Grüner, who has been running the refuge since the 1980s, has invited me
        up here to show me how much the glacier, called

        >has dwindled due to global warming. One startling consequence: its
        meltwater, which used to flow into both Austria to the north and Italy
        to the south, now just flows into one country, Austria. That's because

        gone, those familiar with the glacier say. It's just one example of how

        says Grüner, who grew up in the area, gesturing at the south-facing
        slope. That slope is now rocky and bare.
        <i>"And now it flows down here, and into Austria,"</i> he adds, and
        gestures at the slope below our feet, which points down towards that
        country.

      <h2>Adapting a border</h2>
      <blockquote>"Here in the Alps, one of the most striking consequences of glacier loss
        is the difference in meltwater. For example, when the water suddenly
        goes down the 'wrong' side of a mountain, and is then missing on the
        other side," says Andrea Fischer, a glaciologist and vice-director of
        the Institute of Interdisciplinary Mountain Research at the Austrian
        Academy of Sciences. That's what happened with the Hochjochferner, she
        says. "Because of the glacier's retreat, the meltwater no longer flows
        down to the south, and instead, flows to the north, to Austria."</blockquote>
